# syntax rules
- avoid "try and except" blocks, these are monkey patches, we want to find the true cause and expose the errors
- prefer Path from pathlib over os
- prefer OOP, everything is a class
- prefer match case syntax over "if elif"
- do NOT use "if else" syntax, prefer other methods
- for all classes and functions, keep a single line concise docstring
- lowercase initials for all sentences and docstrings
- no incline comments starting #, if you see any, remove them

# conciseness
- address the issue in the most concise and effective way possible; do not consider all edge cases and waste lines
- always expose the issue and true to find the true fix, do not use monkey patch to hide any problems
- files must not exceed 200 LOC. if they do, breakdown to reusable utils and components
- do NOT use loop in side of a loop
- do not use "raise"s
